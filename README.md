RETURNN development tree
========================

RETURNN - RWTH extensible training framework for universal recurrent neural networks,
is a Theano-based implementation of modern recurrent neural network architectures.
It is optimized for fast and reliable training of recurrent neural networks in a multi-GPU environment.

Features include:

- Mini-batch training of feed-forward neural networks
- Sequence-chunking based batch training for recurrent neural networks
- Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks
- Memory management for large data sets
- Work distribution across multiple devices
